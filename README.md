### Abstract:
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. Our challenge was to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

The app allows the user to select an affirmation or mantra to display. The user can also add or remove their 'favorite' mantras and affirmations to view on their favorites page.

### Context:

This solo challenge was given on week 3 of Module 1 curriculum and students were given 5 days to complete the project along with any additional features. This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where they are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. 

MVP: 
- Build out comp
- When a user selects a message option and then clicks the “Receive Message” button, the user sees a random message from the list of possible messages for that category
- When the message appears, the mediation icon disappears from the message area

  
Additional Features:
- Users should not be able to click the “Receive Message” button unless they have selected a message option.
- Users can click a clear button, which clears the page of any message.
- Users should only be able to click the clear button if a message is visible.
- When the clear button is clicked and the message is removed, the image of the meditation icon should re-appear
- When a message appears, it should appear with a “Favorite” button.
- When the “Favorite” button is clicked, that message should be added to a new list of favorite messages.
- Users should be able to view their favorites by clicking a “View Favorites” button that exists somewhere on the page
- When the “View Favorites” button is clicked, users should be taken to a new page that displays all of their favorite messages.
- Users should be able to navigate back to the main page by clicking a button.
- Users should be able to remove a message from their list of favorites, by clicking a button.
